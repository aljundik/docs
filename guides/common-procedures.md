# Common Procedures

## What to do when you’re the last person leaving the office

1. Shut all windows.
2. Turn off the coffee machines.
3. Fill up the dishwasher and turn it on.
4. Turn off all lights (throughout the entire office complex).
5. Arm the security alarm by the entrance.
6. Leave the office.

To arm the security system, press the button depicting a person standing next to a house and enter the 4-digit passcode. The same code is used for disarming the alarm when entering the office.

If you do not have the passcode, please request it from Janne.

## What to do when you’ve triggered the security alarm by mistake

Press the SOS button on the interface to call the security company's voicemail and leave a message. Alternatively, you can directly call 010 217 9100.

## What to do when you’re sick

1. Inform your team members and clients.
2. Notify Nord Software at #absences on Slack.
3. Mark your absence on Toggl (project/task: **Sick leave**).

As a Nord Software employee, you are eligible to seek medical attention at any of Mehiläinen’s hospitals free of charge.

Please avoid coming to the office if you are sick—it’s good for you and for your buddies!

## What to do before you leave for vacation

Create a Google calendar event that marks the start and end dates of your vacation.
Also remember to create a vacation response in your email settings, see [Gmail settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/general).
