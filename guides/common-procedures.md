# Common Procedures

## What to do when you’re the last person leaving the office

1. Shut all windows.
2. Turn off the coffee machines.
3. Turn off all lights (throughout the entire office complex).
4. Arm the security alarm by the entrance.
5. Leave the office.

Arming the security system requires your personal 4-digit passcode. The same code is used for disarming the alarm when entering the office.

## What to do when you’ve triggered the security alarm by mistake

Call the phone number posted above the alarm interface and tell the security officer what happened.

## What to do when you’re sick

Inform Raisa on Slack or by email as well as any team members and clients you are currently working with.

As a Nord Software employee, you are eligible to seek medical attention at any of Mehiläinen’s hospitals free of charge.

## What to do before you leave for vacation

Create a Google calendar event that marks the start and end dates of your vacation.
