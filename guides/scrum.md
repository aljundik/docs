# Scrum

## Life Cycle

1. Create an initial Product Backlog
2. Sprint Planning Meeting
3. Start Sprint (duration: 2 weeks)
4. Daily Standup Meeting
5. Backlog Refinement Meeting (mid-sprint)
6. Sprint Review Meeting (end of sprint)
7. Sprint Retrospective Meeting (end of sprint)

Rinse and repeat.

## ScrumMaster

A team member who facilitates Scrum (not a project manager).

## Product Owner

A key stakeholder who assumes ownership of the product.

## Sprint

A two-week period during which the team tries to achieve the sprint goal by completing the sprint backlog items.

The outcome of a sprint is a product increment, which is a set of newly developed features. Ideally, the project should be in a state of being potentially shippable at the end of each sprint.

## User Story

A concise description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, commonly a user or customer of the system.

- Example: *As an anonymous user, I want to be able to sign into the application.*

## Task

An auxiliary item that facilitates the completion of a user story item.

- Example: *Write an API controller that handles login requests.*

## Product Backlog

A list of user story items that have not been implemented.

## Sprint Backlog

A list of clearly defined and estimated user story items and tasks that will be implemented in the current sprint.

## Sprint Goal

A one-/two-sentence description of what the team will strive to accomplish in a sprint. It is written collaboratively by the team and product owner.

- Example: *Implement login functionality.*

## Sprint Planning Meeting

The product owner describes the highest priority features to the team. The team asks any questions so that they can write detailed tasks based around high-level user stories.

Sprint backlog items are estimated and pulled by developers (items should not be assigned to others). The team decides how much work they can accomplish in the coming sprint.

- Goal: **Establish a sprint goal and a sprint backlog.**
- Point in time: **Before starting a sprint**
- Duration: **2 hours**
- Attendants: **Product Owner, Scrum team, ScrumMaster**

## Daily Standup Meeting

Each person attending a daily meeting answers the following questions:

- What did you do last?
- What will you do next?
- Do you have any obstacles?

Problems are not solved during the meeting but they are taken offline and usually dealt with by relevant team members after the meeting.

- Goal: **Quick team-wide update, introduce problems**
- Point in time: **Every day**
- Duration: **15 minutes**
- Attendants: **Scrum team, ScrumMaster, Product Owner**

## Backlog Refinement Meeting

Product backlog item definitions are collaboratively improved. They are also estimated by the team. The product owner prioritizes user stories.

- Goal: **Improve the product backlog for the next sprint planning meeting**
- Point in time: **Mid-sprint**
- Duration: **2 hours**
- Attendants: **Scrum team, Product Owner, ScrumMaster**

## Sprint Review Meeting

The team demos the project to the product owner and any stakeholders that may be attending the meeting.

The team checks which sprint backlog items are considered done and assesses the project against the sprint goal. Incomplete items are returned to the product backlog and reprioritized by the product owner.

The team creates new product backlog items based on the product owner’s and stakeholders’ feedback.

- Goal: **Demo project, assess against sprint goal, create new items, reprioritize items**
- Point in time: **End of sprint**
- Duration: **2 hours**
- Attendants: **Product Owner, Scrum team, stakeholders, ScrumMaster**

## Sprint Retrospective Meeting

Each team member identifies specific things that the team should (1) start doing, (2) stop doing, and (3) continue doing. The team votes on items to focus on during the next sprint. The ScrumMaster should record these things in a shared document.

The following sprint retrospective meeting is begun by reviewing the previous document and by assessing the team’s workflow.

- Goal: **Evaluate a sprint’s workflow**
- Point in time: **End of sprint**
- Duration: **1 hour**
- Attendants: **Scrum team, ScrumMaster, Product Owner**

## Story Points

- *0* - does not take any time at all
- *0.5* - a task that is smaller than the smallest task previously estimated
- *Fibonacci numbers between 1 and 20* - a task that takes less than two days

Any user stories larger than 20 story points should be broken down into smaller parts.
