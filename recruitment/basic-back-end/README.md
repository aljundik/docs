# Basic back-end

This is a preliminary test to determine the technical ability of developers applying for back-end positions at Nord Software.

Before starting, please read carefully through the instructions below. You are free to look up any information online and offline and spend as much time on the test as you deem necessary. Please direct any questions to Eric Nishio (eric.nishio@nordsoftware.com).

Your task is to create a small application that meets the following requirements:

- Create a MySQL table called `person` that contains the following columns: **id** (auto-increment), **name** (varchar), **gender** (enum), **age** (int)
- Write a PHP script that connects to the database and outputs all `person` entries as JSON.
- Write a PHP script that inserts a new person into the table based on POST data and outputs all entries (incl. the new person) as JSON.
- Write a PHP script that deletes an existing person from the table based on their `id` and outputs all the remaining entries as JSON.

You will receive extra points for

- Input validation
- Using object-oriented PHP
- Using a PHP framework or library
- RESTful API design
- A developer-friendly installation guide

Upon completing the test, please deliver the code as a zip file named `basic-back-end.zip` and send it to eric.nishio@nordsoftware.com.

Good luck!
